data_social_struct contain data of each 

	.Onset 	: 163 ligne for 163 trials, 5 column for 5 onsets (Fixation cross, cue, decision of participant, decision of computer, outcome).
	.NbComb : number of times each history of past two partcipant's choices and outcome appear. 16 possible histories.
	.NbD	: number of time the participant play right target after the each history among the 16 possible.
	.data 	: Behavioral data. 1st column is the trial number. 2nd is the binary outcome of the trial for the participant (1=win). 3rd is the binary outcome of the trial for the algorithm (1=win). 4th. is the selected target of the participant (1=left, 3=right). 5th. is the selected target of the algorithm (1=left, 3=right). 6th. reaction time (between cue apparition and button press). 7th. computer's mode of play (0= random, 1= competitif, 2= cooperatif). 8th. Computed probability that the participant choose right target. 


Behravioral.dta contains the data of participants

Generative.dta contains data that the models generateded. The mode as 3 values : 
	mode = 7 for data generated by the competitive influence model
	mode = 8 for data generated by the cooperative influence model
	mode = 9 for data generated by the mixed influence model
